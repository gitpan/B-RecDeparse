NAME
    B::RecDeparse - Deparse recursively into subroutines.

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        perl -MO=RecDeparse,deparse,[@B__Deparse_opts],level,-1 [ -e '...' | bleh.pl ]

        # Or as a module :
        use B::RecDeparse;

        my $brd = B::RecDeparse->new(deparse => [ @b__deparse_opts ], level => $level);
        my $code = $brd->coderef2text(sub { ... });

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends B::Deparse by making it recursively replace
    subroutine calls encountered when deparsing.

    Please refer to B::Deparse documentation for what to do and how to do
    it. Besides the constructor syntax, everything should work the same for
    the two modules.

METHODS
  "new < deparse => [ @B__Deparse_opts ], level => $level >"
    The B::RecDeparse object constructor. You can specify the underlying
    B::Deparse constructor arguments by passing a string or an array
    reference as the value of the "deparse" key. The "level" option expects
    an integer that specifies how many levels of recursions are allowed : -1
    means infinite while 0 means none and match B::Deparse behaviour.

  "compile"
  "init"
  "deparse_sub"
  "pp_entersub"
  "pp_refgen"
  "pp_gv"
    Functions and methods from B::Deparse reimplemented by this module.
    Never call them directly.

    Otherwise, B::RecDeparse inherits all methods from B::Deparse.

EXPORT
    An object-oriented module shouldn't export any function, and so does
    this one.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.8.1.

    Carp (standard since perl 5), Config (since perl 5.00307) and B::Deparse
    (since perl 5.005).
