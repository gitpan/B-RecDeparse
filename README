NAME
    B::RecDeparse - Deparse recursively into subroutines.

VERSION
    Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
        # Deparse recursively a Perl one-liner :
        $ perl -MO=RecDeparse,deparse,@B__Deparse_opts,level,-1 -e '...'

        # Or a complete Perl script :
        $ perl -MO=RecDeparse,deparse,@B__Deparse_opts,level,-1 x.pl

        # Or a single code reference :
        use B::RecDeparse;

        my $brd = B::RecDeparse->new(
         deparse => \@B__Deparse_opts,
         level   => $level,
        );
        my $code = $brd->coderef2text(sub { ... });

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends B::Deparse by making it recursively replace
    subroutine calls encountered when deparsing.

    Please refer to B::Deparse documentation for what to do and how to do
    it. Besides the constructor syntax, everything should work the same for
    the two modules.

METHODS
  "new"
        my $brd = B::RecDeparse->new(
         deparse => \@B__Deparse_opts,
         level   => $level,
        );

    The B::RecDeparse object constructor. You can specify the underlying
    B::Deparse constructor arguments by passing a string or an array
    reference as the value of the "deparse" key. The "level" option expects
    an integer that specifies how many levels of recursions are allowed : -1
    means infinite while 0 means none and match B::Deparse behaviour.

    The following functions and methods from B::Deparse are reimplemented by
    this module :

    *   "compile"

    *   "init"

    *   "deparse_sub"

    *   "pp_entersub"

    *   "pp_refgen"

    *   "pp_gv"

    Otherwise, B::RecDeparse inherits all methods from B::Deparse.

EXPORT
    An object-oriented module shouldn't export any function, and so does
    this one.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.8.1.

    Carp (standard since perl 5), Config (since perl 5.00307) and B::Deparse
    (since perl 5.005).
